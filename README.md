# HMM-Markov Model
Python simplified code for Forward Backward and Direct Sampling.

The code contains 20 sequence lenght and sampling the sequences for 15 iterations.

The code runs : 
1) Forward Algorithm
2) Backward Algorithm
3) Final Observations ( multiples the forward and backward sequence and then returns the states of the particular observations)
4) Direct Sampling.
